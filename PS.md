# Personal Statement

I am a senior student at Xi'an Jiaotong University.And this is my personal sttement.

## Why CS?

When I was in senior high school, our school forbade us to go out unless it's weekend. We cannot take laptop or phone too.  
One day, school prepared to choose some students to participate in NOIP.
And I wanted to play computer legally in weekdays. So I applied and passed the test.  
However, our school's computer used Linux rather than Windows. My plan has failed. But after I joined our school's team for a period of time, I started to like researching algorithms, and then I fell in love with CS.  

## Why AI? & My experiences

This part is too long, so I fold it. If you don't want to read my cumbersome experience, the reason can be summarized as one word: I believe AI can resolve the most of issues in the world.

<details> 
I was born in a normal family. My parents are both low-level workers, salary is around 3000 yuan per person per month. They are all very nice person.

When I was in grade 7, my father happened a car crash, and he become a vegetable. Then my grandfather found my parents has divorced a long time ago when the court requires my family to provide the victim's family relationship, which is unacceptable for him since his relatively conservative ideas. In extreme sadness and anger, he was paralyzed and passed away soon after.

The driver who caused the accident is unable to pay compensation, we only get a meager amount of money. My grandmother has cardiopathy, and we did not have enough money to hire a support worker, so my mother have to undertake the task of taking care of my father. For that, she resigned.

We began to worry about our daily food and my tuition fees. No one lend us money since they don't believe we would be able to pay back the debt. We sold our house to pay for my father's surgery, and my maternal grandparent used all of their old-age pension to support us. Fortunately, we passed that time.

After that, I start to be able to see the suffering in society. I saw migrant workers kneeling and begging the boss to pay their wages. I heard the cries of the elderly person whose spine was broken due to petitioning. I smelled the stench of the homeless man who had to live in unfinished building. I touched the tears of those who were laid off in the wave of unemployment. I found there are so much pain in this world, but I knew nothing before.

All of these are not simple issues. They are caused by multiple underlying issues(e.g:imbalance between government and citizen power, shortcomings in productivity development, backward cultural level and ideological concepts of citizens), which cannot be solved by promulgating a law,fighting a war,changing a leader, overthrow a government, even adopting a new regime. We need more high-level talents, and do not use too much resource.

This makes AI&robots become a excellent options. You need about 100k dollar and 20 years to bring up a person, but you only need 2000$ and less than one week to train a GPT4ALL/LLaMA, which can complete almost all kinds of works that can be done on computer. You need 1000$ per month to hire a cook, and one cook robot's price is 500$. AI is an perfect tool that can complete extremely complex tasks while maintaining a certain degree of controllability. It does not have its own needs, and with proper training, it can serve the people and never engage in corruption. It can increase the productivity dramatically and distribute material wealth fairly, then can we truly liberate all those in distress.

## Why Study Abroad?

1. For researching, enough communication with top personnel in the industry is indispensable. So I want to go out to see the world and meeting more people come from different area.
2. The employment situation in recent years in China has been quite severe. It's also make it easier for me to have funding sources to ensure that my dad won't be kicked out of the hospital for not having enough money.

## Why full-funding Ph.D./Master?

AS you now, I'm a poor guy. Training AI needs a lot of money to buy GPU, which is unaffordable for me. If you need a research assistant, please also consider me.

## Relevant experience & Merits & Disadvantages

Please read my CV.

## Future planning

I'm interested in Unsupervised Learning/multimodal/LLM/Autonomous AI. Of course I will prioritize following the mentor's decision. After graduating with a master's degree, I want to continue pursuing a doctoral degree.
